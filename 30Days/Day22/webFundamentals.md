## Intro to cURL

By default, cURL will perform GET requests on whatever URL you supply it, such as:


```
	curl https://tryhackme.com

```


This would retrieve the main page for tryhackme with a GET request. Using command line flags for cURL, we can do a lot more than just GET content. The -X flag allows us to specify the request type, eg -X POST. You can specify the data to POST with --data, which will default to plain text data. It's worth mentioning cURL does not store cookies, and you have to manually specify any cookies and values that you would like to send with your request. If you want to send cookies from cURL, you can look up how to do this.

Remember, cookies are not shared between different browsers (I'm counting cURL as a browser here).



### Tasks



There's a web server running on http://MACHINE_IP:8081. Connect to it and get the flags!

    GET request. Make a GET request to the web server with path /ctf/get
    POST request. Make a POST request with the body "flag_please" to /ctf/post
    Get a cookie. Make a GET request to /ctf/getcookie and check the cookie the server gives you
    Set a cookie. Set a cookie with name "flagpls" and value "flagpls" in your devtools (or with curl!) and make a GET request to /ctf/sendcookie
