-   Metasploit

    - Metasploit is one of the most popular penetration testing frameworks around. It contains a large database of almost every major CVE, which you can easily use against a machine. The aim of this section is to go through some of the major features of metasploit, and at the end there will be a machine that you will need to exploit.

-   Hash

    - Often times during a pen test, you will gain access to a database. When you investigate the database you will often find a users table, which contains usernames and often hashed passwords. It is often necessary to know how to crack hashed passwords to gain authentication to a website(or if you're lucky a hashed password may work for ssh!).

    - Hashcat

      - hashcat is another one of the most popular hash cracking tools. It is renowned for its versatility and speed. Hashcat does not have auto detection for hashtypes, instead it has modes. For example if you were trying to crack an md5 hash the "mode" would be 0, while if you were trying to crack a sha1 hash, the mode would be 100.

    - John The Ripper(jtr)
      - John The Ripper(jtr) is one of the best hash cracking tools available. It supports numerous formats of hashes and is extremely easy to use, while having a lot of options for customization.
