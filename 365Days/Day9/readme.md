-   Steghide

    - Steghide is one of the most famous steganography tools, and for good reason. It's a classic method, hiding a message inside an image, and steghide does it effectively and efficiently. A downside of steghide is that it only works on jpgs; however, that means that if you believe there is a hidden message inside a jpg, then steghide is a probable option.
