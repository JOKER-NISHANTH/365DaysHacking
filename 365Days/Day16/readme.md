## TryHackMe CC: Steganography

[TryHackMe]((https://tryhackme.com/room/ccstego))

- Steganography(Stego) is the art of concealing something inside something else, for example: A message inside a jpg file, or a binary inside a png. Stego has been used since ancient times to deliver messages that they don't want others seeing. In the modern day it's used for the same purpose, only now we have much more advanced tools. This room is designed to go over those tools and how to use them.
